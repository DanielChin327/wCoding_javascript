  <h1>Welcome to Omikuji Fortune Drawing</h1>
  <p>
    Omikuji are Japanese fortune-telling paper strips that you can find at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples across Japan. The word "omikuji" literally means "sacred lot" and they are a fun and traditional way to receive guidance and predictions about various aspects of your life. Whether you are seeking advice on health, love, success, or general well-being, drawing an omikuji is a cherished custom that connects modern life with ancient practices.

  <p>
    Typically, you draw an omikuji by shaking a cylindrical container full of numbered sticks until one stick falls out. The number on the stick corresponds to a drawer that contains your fortune. The fortune ranges from great blessings (大吉, Daikichi) to great curses (大凶, Daikyō), and everything in between. No matter what fortune you receive, it is customary to fold the paper and tie it to a designated tree or rack at the shrine, leaving behind the bad fortune or amplifying the good one.
